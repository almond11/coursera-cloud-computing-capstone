# Capstone Cloud-Computing

This project contains the scripts and code of my submission for the Capstone project of the Coursera Cloud Computing Specialization.

The goal of the Capstone project in this Cloud Computing specialization was to apply in practice the knowledge and skills gained throughout the different courses by analyzing a public transportation dataset of the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A set of questions had to be solved using the techniques and frameworks presented in the courses.

## Part 1 - Batch processing

The first part of the Capstone project focuses on using batch processing systems to solve the presented questions.
